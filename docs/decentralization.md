# Nexus and HS Decentralization — Configuration Reference

These are technical notes describing configuration fields related to Decentralization.

---

## 1. Background

Originally the watcher pointed at one default homeserver and bulk-ingested all of
its events. With decentralization, Nexus still bulk-indexes the default HS but
*also* indexes users hosted on other ("third-party") homeservers on a per-user
basis, using each homeserver's user-events endpoint. A separate task resolves each user's
currently-published HS from PKDNS/DHT and records it as a
`(:User)-[:HOSTED_BY]->(:Homeserver)` edge, so the indexer knows which users to
pull from which HS.

This runs as parallel tasks started in `NexusWatcher::start`, each driving one runner:
- `HsEventProcessorRunner` — bulk indexing of the default HS (Section 2)
- `KeyBasedEventProcessorRunner` — key-based indexing of externally-hosted users (Section 3)
- `UserHsResolverRunner` (Section 4), and
- `RetryProcessor` (`[watcher.retry]`, Section 5, applies to all indexing)

The sections below group each config field under the runner it drives.

## 2. Indexing the default homeserver (bulk)

The baseline, pre-decentralization path: the default HS is indexed in *bulk* — all
of its events are pulled in batches. Driven by `HsEventProcessorRunner`.

### `[watcher].homeserver`
- **Type / default:** `PubkyId` / Synonym's HS key (see `default.config.toml`).
- **What it does:** The single default, prioritized homeserver. Its events are
  bulk-ingested, and it is explicitly *excluded* from the third-party
  (`KeyBasedEventProcessorRunner`) list so it is never double-indexed
  (`hs_by_priority`).
- **Notes:** Changing this re-points the entire default-HS pipeline. The HS is
  persisted to the graph on startup (`Homeserver::persist_if_unknown`).

### `[watcher].events_limit`
- **Type / default / max:** `u16` / `50` in the shipped config (code default
  `1000`) / **max `1000`** (`MAX_EVENTS_LIMIT`).
- **What it does:** Maximum number of events fetched **per run** from the default
  HS. Validated at deserialize time (`deserialize_events_limit`): `0` is
  rejected, and values above the max are rejected rather than clamped.
- **Tuning:** Higher → more throughput per tick but larger batches and longer
  per-run latency. Lower → smoother but slower to drain a backlog.

### `[watcher].watcher_sleep`
- **Type / default:** `u64` milliseconds / `5000`.
- **What it does:** Sleep between full runs for **both** event-processing runners
  (`HsEventProcessorRunner` + `KeyBasedEventProcessorRunner`). It is the master
  tick for indexing.
- **Tuning:** Lower → fresher data, more load on HSs and DBs. Higher → less load,
  more lag between an event being published and indexed.

## 3. Indexing externally-hosted users (key-based)

The core of decentralization. Driven by `KeyBasedEventProcessorRunner`, which
indexes users hosted on non-default ("third-party") homeservers: for every
monitored HS *except* the default, it pulls each hosted user's events per user
via the HS user-events endpoint (hence "key-based" — keyed on each user's
pubky). Configured in `KeyBasedEventProcessorRunner::from_config`.

### `[watcher].monitored_homeservers_limit`
- **Type / default:** `usize` / `50` (`DEFAULT_MONITORED_HOMESERVERS_LIMIT`).
- **What it does:** Bounds the number of **external** HSs monitored.
- **Notes:** `0` disables external-HS indexing; `1` monitors one external HS.
- **Tuning:** Each additional monitored HS adds HS requests (and, upstream, PKDNS
  resolutions) per tick. Raise deliberately as the network of indexed HSs grows.

### `[watcher].key_based_events_limit`
- **Type / default / max:** `u16` / `50`
  (`DEFAULT_KEY_BASED_EVENTS_LIMIT`) / **max `100`**
  (`MAX_KEY_BASED_EVENTS_LIMIT`). Validated at deserialize time
  (`deserialize_key_based_events_limit`).
- **What it does:** Maximum events **per user, per run** when pulling from
  non-default HSs.
- **Why the ceiling is lower than `events_limit`:** this limit is *per user*, not
  *per HS*. A run may touch many users across many HSs, so the per-user batch is
  kept small to bound total work and per-HS request size.

### Offline-HS backoff: `[watcher].initial_backoff_secs` / `[watcher].max_backoff_secs`
- **Type / default:** `u64` seconds / `60` and `3600`
  (`DEFAULT_INITIAL_BACKOFF_SECS`, `DEFAULT_MAX_BACKOFF_SECS`).
- **What it does:** Per-HS exponential backoff for homeservers found to be
  **offline/unreachable** (`HomeserverBackoff`). After a failure the HS is skipped for
  `initial_backoff_secs`; the skip interval doubles on each consecutive failure,
  capped at `max_backoff_secs`.
- **Constraint:** `initial_backoff_secs` must not exceed `max_backoff_secs`
  (`HomeserverBackoff::new`).
- **Tuning:** Larger initial/cap → fewer wasted requests to dead HSs, but slower
  to notice one coming back. Smaller → faster recovery, more retry traffic.

> ⚠️ **Do not confuse these with `[watcher.retry].initial_backoff_secs` /
> `max_backoff_secs`.** Same names, different mechanism — see Section 5.

### HS public-key blacklist: `[stack].external_hs_pk_blacklist`

List of external HS PKs from which new events are not being indexed, for as long as they are on this list.

- **Type / default:** `Vec<PubkyId>` / `[]` (empty). Each entry is parsed as a
  `PubkyId` at deserialize time, so an invalid pubky in the list fails config
  load rather than being silently ignored (`test_external_hs_pk_blacklist_rejects_invalid_pk`).

This list is consulted when indexing 3rd party HSs. Any existing events from users pointing to one of these HSs are not affected.

This list is also checked when ingesting new users, for example via the Nexus REST API. New users which point to one of these HSs will not be ingested. Any users that already were ingested, who now point to a blacklisted HS, are not affected in the sense that their old data is not deleted; however new events from their new blacklisted HS are not being indexed.

Events that depend on a not-yet-ingested user hosted by a blacklisted HS (a follow of such a user, a tag on them or their posts, a reply or repost referencing their posts) are dropped rather than queued for retry, since the dependency cannot be ingested while the HS is blacklisted. Removing the HS from the list later does not recover these dropped events. Posts that merely mention such a user are still indexed; only the mention relationship is not materialized.

## 4. User → homeserver resolution

Driven by `UserHsResolverRunner`. For each user it resolves the currently
published HS from PKDNS/DHT and persists/refreshes the
`(:User)-[:HOSTED_BY]->(:Homeserver)` edge with a `resolved_at` timestamp.
This is what tells the externally-hosted-user indexer (Section 3) which
users belong to which HS.

### `hs_resolver_sleep`
- **Type / default:** `u64` milliseconds / `10000` (`DEFAULT_HS_RESOLVER_SLEEP`).
- **What it does:** Sleep between runs of the resolver task. **Independent** of
  `watcher_sleep` — resolution and indexing tick on separate clocks.
- **Tuning:** Lower → mappings react faster to users migrating HSs, more PKDNS/DHT
  traffic. Higher → less traffic, slower to notice a user's HS change.

### `hs_resolver_ttl`
- **Type / default:** `u64` milliseconds / `3_600_000` (1 hour,
  `DEFAULT_HS_RESOLVER_TTL`).
- **What it does:** Minimum age before a user's HS mapping is considered stale and
  eligible for re-resolution. A user whose `HOSTED_BY.resolved_at` is newer than
  this TTL is **skipped** on a resolver run, preventing redundant PKDNS lookups.
- **Tuning:** Lower → mappings stay fresher at the cost of far more PKDNS lookups.
  Higher → cheaper, but Nexus may keep pulling a user's events from an HS they
  have already left for up to ~`hs_resolver_ttl`.

## 5. Event retry & backoff — `[watcher.retry]`

Cross-cutting: applies to **all** indexing, driven by
`RetryProcessor`. Backoff parameters are selected per error
via `EventRetryConfig::get_backoff_params` / `get_max_retries_for_err`: *transient*
errors and *missing-dependency* errors use separate limits.

| Field | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `max_retries` | `10` | Transient-error retry limit before an event is dead-lettered. |
| `max_dependency_retries` | `50` | Retry limit for `MissingDependency` — safety net for HSs that disappear silently (content gone, no DEL event). Higher than `max_retries` because the dependency may still arrive. |
| `initial_backoff_secs` | `10` | Base for exponential backoff on **transient** retries (seconds). |
| `max_backoff_secs` | `3600` | Backoff ceiling for transient retries. |
| `initial_missing_dep_backoff_secs` | `60` | Base for `MissingDependency` polling backoff. |
| `max_missing_dep_backoff_secs` | `3600` | Backoff ceiling for `MissingDependency`. |

> ⚠️ **Two distinct "backoff" systems — do not conflate them:**
>
> - **`[watcher].initial_backoff_secs` / `max_backoff_secs`** (Section 3) — skips
>   an **entire homeserver** found to be **offline/unreachable**.
> - **`[watcher.retry].initial_backoff_secs` / `max_backoff_secs`** — retries an
>   **individual event** that hit a **transient processing error**.
>
> They share field names but operate at different granularities (HS vs. event)
> and on different triggers (unreachable vs. transient failure).

## 6. Testnet / general

Relevant only insofar as they switch the HS/relay target during local/dev runs.

| Field | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `testnet` | `false` | Run against a testnet homeserver/relay instead of mainnet. |
| `testnet_host` | `"localhost"` | Host for the testnet HS/relay; change only if it runs on another machine (e.g. Docker setups). |
