The files that have a `.tldr` extension can be imported into https://www.tldraw.com/. 

This file format is specifically designed for use with the tldraw application, which is an online drawing and diagramming tool. By importing `tldr` files into tldraw, users can open, view, and edit drawings or diagrams that were previously created using the platform.
