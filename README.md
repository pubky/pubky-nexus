# Pubky-Nexus

The Nexus between Pubky homeservers and Pubky-App social frontend. Pubky Nexus constructs a social graph out of all of the events on pubky-core homeservers and exposes a social-media-like API capable of powerful Web-of-Trust inference.

## üíª Development Roadmap

### [Pubky Backend Development Roadmap](https://github.com/pubky/pubky-app-backend/issues/1)

## üèóÔ∏è Objective for Alpha v0.1.0 Milestone

Reach feature parity with `skunk-work` indexer improving on the following:

1. High performance: no inefficient lookups, maximum normalization, maximum atomic indexing, full async, full multi-thread, rust performance.
2. Clear vision forward: esimplify the implementation of exciting future features: WoT, graph queries, etc.
3. Free of bugs: hopefully.
4. Cleaner dev experience.
5. Moden stack.
6. Excellent observability (browse over our indexes with [redis-insight](https://redis.io/insight/) or graph with [neo4j-browser](https://browser.neo4j.io/))

## üè†Architecture

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e516ceff-d28f-4d71-9123-96eb1725cd73)

- **service.rs**: binary that serves REST request to the pubky-app clients reading from our DBs.
- **watcher.rs**: binary that subscribes to homeservers and populate our DBs
- **lib.rs**: library crate with all of the common functionalities (connector, models, queries) needed for `watcher` and `service`

1. The watcher does effectively work as an aggregator (a translator from Homeserver events to a social network graph).
2. The service reads from the indexes and performs queries to the graph in order to serve responses to the pubky-app clients.
3. As long as it is possible and not too troublesome, most relationships, query results and cache should be indexed by `key: value` and retrieved from Redis. We should take inspiration on current use of LMDB in `skunk-works` (a lot of things can be done using plain `key: value` but some are too troublesome to implement: then we query our graph directly)
4. The social graph DB (Neo4J) is intended for holding a complete view of the network. It should be queried as little as possible but we can abuse it at the beginning in order to complete features faster.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Quick Dev

For auto re-build on save and testing while developing `/service` :

```bash
cargo install cargo-watch

# Ideally in two terminals.
# On terminal 1 run:
cargo watch -q -c -w src/ -x "run --bin pubky-nexus-service"
# You can check the running service on your browser on localhost:8080/info

# On terminal 2 run (for tests to work you need a working /neo4j-example instance with example dataset)
cargo watch -q -c -w tests/ -x "test -- --nocapture"

# Run benchmarks (e.g., get profile by ID benchmark)
cargo bench --bench profile
```

### Real time explore the databases

- Redis: http://localhost:8001/redis-stack/browser
- Neo4J: http://localhost:7474/browser/
