# Pubky Nexus

Pubky Nexus is the central bridge connecting Pubky homeservers with Pubky-App‚Äôs social clients. By aggregating events from homeservers into a rich social graph, Nexus transforms decentralized interactions into a high-performance, fully featured social-media-like API. It's designed to support Social-Semantic-Graph (SSG) inference, and more.

## üåü Key Features

- **Real-time Social Graph Aggregation**: Nexus ingests events from multiple Pubky homeservers, generating a structured social graph in real time.
- **Full-Content Indexing**: Nexus serves content directly, improving latency and user experience. Clients do not need to locate homeservers to retrieve content unless they wish to perform content attestation. We also envision a light-weight Nexus mode that merely point clients to homeserver locations using pubky uris.
- **High Performance & Scalability**: Built in Rust, Nexus is optimized for speed and efficiency, handling complex social queries across distributed systems with minimal latency.
- **Powerful Social Semantic Graph**: Nexus supports SSG-based interactions, fostering secure and trusted connections between users.
- **Graph-Enhanced Search & Recommendations**: Nexus leverages Neo4j to offer deep insights, relationships, and recommendations based on the social graph.
- **Flexible Caching Layer**: A Redis cache accelerates access to common queries and minimizes database load, ensuring a smooth user experience. Most requests can be served in less than 1 ms at constant time complexity with respect number of users.
- **Rich Observability**: Easily explore the indexed data using [Redis Insight](https://redis.io/insight/) and visualize the graph database with [Neo4j Browser](https://browser.neo4j.io/).

## üåê Accessing the API

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: The API is currently **unstable**. We are using the `/v0` route prefix while the API undergoes active development and changes. Expect potential breaking changes as we work toward stability.

Nexus provides a REST API, accessible via Swagger UI:

- **Staging API** (latest): [https://nexus.staging.pubky.app/swagger-ui/](https://nexus.staging.pubky.app/swagger-ui/)
- **Production API** (current): [https://nexus.pubky.app/swagger-ui/](https://nexus.pubky.app/swagger-ui/)

You can explore available endpoints, test queries, and view schema definitions directly within Swagger.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Nexus is composed of several core components:

- **service.rs**: The REST API server for handling client requests, querying databases, and returning responses to the Pubky-App frontend.
- **watcher.rs**: The event aggregator that listens to homeserver events, translating them into social graph updates within the Nexus databases.
- **lib.rs**: A library crate containing common functionalities shared by `service` and `watcher`, including database connectors, models, and queries.

### Data Flow

![pubky-nexus-arch](docs/images/pubky-nexus-arch.png)

1. **Event Ingestion**: The watcher ingests events from Pubky homeservers and indexes them into our social graph.
2. **Indexing and Caching**: Relationships, common queries, and graph data are cached in Redis for high-speed access. Complex queries use Neo4j.
3. **API Responses**: The service server reads from these indexes to respond to client queries efficiently.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up the Development Environment

To get started with Nexus, first set up the required databases: Neo4j and Redis.

### 1. Configure Databases

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Copy the environment template and set up the Docker environment:

    ```bash
    cd docker
    cp .env-sample .env
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3. Populate the Neo4j database with initial data:

    ```bash
    docker exec neo4j bash /db-graph/run-queries.sh
    ```

Once the `Neo4j` graph database is seeded with data, the next step is to populate the `Redis` database by running the _nexus-service_

> If the Redis cache is empty, the nexus-service will handle it automatically. If not follow the steps of warning section

4. Run the Nexus service:

    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
5. Run the Watcher service:

    ```bash
    cargo run --bin watcher
    ```
6. **Access Redis and Neo4j UIs**:
   - Redis UI: [http://localhost:8001/redis-stack/browser](http://localhost:8001/redis-stack/browser)
   - Neo4J UI: [http://localhost:7474/browser/](http://localhost:7474/browser/)

## üöÄ Contributing

To contribute to Nexus, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository** and create a feature branch.
2. **Write Tests**: Ensure new features and changes are tested and benchmarked.
3. **Submit a Pull Request** and provide a description of the changes.

### Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

To test specific modules or features:

```bash
cargo test watcher:users
cargo test test_homeserver_user_event
```

**Benchmarking**:

```bash
cargo bench --bench user get_user_view_by_id
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If tests or the development environment seem out of sync, follow these steps to reset:

1. **Reset Neo4j**:

    ```bash
    docker exec neo4j bash -c "cypher-shell -u neo4j -p 12345678 'MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n;'"
    docker exec neo4j bash /db-graph/run-queries.sh
    ```

2. **Re-index Redis Cache**:

    ```bash
    REINDEX=true cargo run
    ```
