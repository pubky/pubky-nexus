# Pubky-Nexus

The Nexus between Pubky homeservers and Pubky-App social frontend. Pubky Nexus constructs a social graph out of all of the events on pubky-core homeservers and exposes a social-media-like API capable of powerful Web-of-Trust inference.

## üíª Development Roadmap

### [Pubky Backend Development Roadmap](https://github.com/pubky/pubky-app-backend/issues/1)

## üèóÔ∏è Objective for Alpha v0.1.0 Milestone

Reach feature parity with `skunk-work` indexer improving on the following:

1. High performance: no inefficient lookups, maximum normalization, maximum atomic indexing, full async, full multi-thread, rust performance.
2. Clear vision forward: simplify the implementation of exciting future features: WoT, graph queries, etc.
3. Free of bugs: hopefully.
4. Cleaner dev experience.
5. Moden stack.
6. Excellent observability (browse over our indexes with [redis-insight](https://redis.io/insight/) or graph with [neo4j-browser](https://browser.neo4j.io/))

## üè†Architecture

![pubky-nexus-arch](docs/images/pubky-nexus-arch.png)

- **service.rs**: binary that serves REST request to the pubky-app clients reading from our DBs.
- **watcher.rs**: binary that subscribes to homeservers and populate our DBs
- **lib.rs**: library crate with all of the common functionalities (connector, models, queries) needed for `watcher` and `service`

1. The watcher does effectively work as an aggregator (a translator from Homeserver events to a social network graph).
2. The service reads from the indexes and performs queries to the graph in order to serve responses to the pubky-app clients.
3. As long as it is possible and not too troublesome, most relationships, query results and cache should be indexed by `key: value` and retrieved from Redis. We should take inspiration on current use of LMDB in `skunk-works` (a lot of things can be done using plain `key: value` but some are too troublesome to implement: then we query our graph directly)
4. The social graph DB (Neo4J) is intended for holding a complete view of the network. It should be queried as little as possible but we can abuse it at the beginning in order to complete features faster.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preparing the Environment

Before running the project, several configurations must be set up. Let‚Äôs start by configuring the databases

```bash
cd docker
# Create a new `.env` file from the `.env-sample` template
cp .env-sample .env
# Run the databases (Neo4j and Redis databases will spin up empty)
docker-compose up -d
# Populate the graph database with initial data
docker exec neo4j bash /db-graph/run-queries.sh
```

Once the `Neo4j` graph database is seeded with data, the next step is to populate the `Redis` database by running the _nexus-service_

> If the Redis cache is empty, the nexus-service will handle it automatically. If not follow the steps of warning section

```bash
cargo run
```

## üë®‚Äçüíª Quick Development Setup

To enable auto-rebuilding and testing while developing within the `/service`:

```bash
# Install `cargo-watch` to monitor changes and auto-rebuild on save
cargo install cargo-watch
# Ensure the environment variables are set. You might have already done this in the previous step:
cp .env-sample .env
# Run the service and tests in separate terminals:

# Terminal 1: Start the service with auto-reload on changes:
cargo watch -q -c -w src/ -x "run --bin service"
# The service will be available at localhost:8080/v0/info on your browser

# Terminal 2: Run tests (note that for tests to pass, the Neo4j instance must have example data)
# Ensure you've followed the steps above to set up Neo4j with the example dataset
cargo watch -q -c -w tests/ -x "test -- --nocapture"
# Test specific folder of a domain
cargo test watcher:users
# Test specific test
cargo test test_homeserver_user_event
# Run benchmarks (e.g., get user by ID benchmark)
cargo bench --bench user get_user_view_by_id
```

## Developing the homeserver watcher

Running the `/tests/` that require the homeserver does not require running a homeserver. However, running the playground or the `watcher.rs` binary does. This is how you can run a pubky homeserver locally in testnet mode.

We are using `pubky` repo as a git submodule of `pubky-nexus`, given that `pubky` is still a private repository and the crates for the client and homeserver are not yet published.

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd pubky/pubky-homeserver
cargo run -- --testnet
```

Take a look at the logs for

1. `testnet.bootstrap=["127.0.0.1:6881"]`
2. Your homeserver listening url `http://localhost:15411` and
3. the pubky URI `pubky://8pinxxgqs41n4aididenw5apqp1urfmzdztr8jt4abrkdn435ewo` and make sure your `.env` has the correct settings

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

There are scenarios where the **integration tests** might fail. This typically occurs when new changes are pulled from the repository, as the schemas for our indexes may have changed, or when the database data is out of sync with the current integration tests. To resolve this, you need to reset the Neo4j graph database and Redis cache, and then re-seed them with the correct data. Follow these steps:

### Real time explore the databases

```bash
# Run the following Cypher query to remove all nodes and relationships in the database
docker exec neo4j bash -c "cypher-shell -u neo4j -p 12345678 'MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n;'"
# Re-populate the database with the correct dataset
docker exec neo4j bash /db-graph/run-queries.sh
# Set the REINDEX environment variable to true for the reindexing process
REINDEX=true
# Start the reindexing process
cargo run
# After reindexing, set REINDEX to false to prevent reindexing on every build
REINDEX=false
```

In some cases, compilation might fail due to issues with the dependency in the pubky repository. To resolve this, run the following command:

```bash
git pull --recurse-submodule
```
